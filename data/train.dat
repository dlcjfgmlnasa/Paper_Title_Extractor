Given this landscape & roadmap, we predict that deep cortical learning will be the convergence of deep learning & cortical learning which builds an artificial cortical column ultimately.
Insensitive Stochastic Gradient Twin Support Vector Machine for Large Scale Problems	Stochastic gradient descent algorithm has been successfully applied on support vector machines (called PEGASOS) for many classification problems. In this paper, stochastic gradient descent algorithm is investigated to twin support vector machines for classification. Compared with PEGASOS, the proposed stochastic gradient twin support vector machines (SGTSVM) is insensitive on stochastic sampling for stochastic gradient descent algorithm. In theory, we prove the convergence of SGTSVM instead of almost sure convergence of PEGASOS. For uniformly sampling, the approximation between SGTSVM and twin support vector machines is also given, while PEGASOS only has an opportunity to obtain an approximation of support vector machines. In addition, the nonlinear SGTSVM is derived directly from its linear case. Experimental results on both artificial datasets and large scale problems show the stable performance of SGTSVM with a fast learning speed.
Linear Classification of data with Support Vector Machines and Generalized Support Vector Machines	In this paper, we study the support vector machine and introduced the notion of generalized support vector machine for classification of data. We show that the problem of generalized support vector machine is equivalent to the problem of generalized variational inequality and establish various results for the existence of solutions. Moreover, we provide various examples to support our results.
ILP-M Conv: Optimize Convolution Algorithm for Single-Image Convolution Neural Network Inference on Mobile GPUs	Convolution neural networks are widely used for mobile applications. However, GPU convolution algorithms are designed for mini-batch neural network training, the single-image convolution neural network inference algorithm on mobile GPUs is not well-studied. After discussing the usage difference and examining the existing convolution algorithms, we proposed the HNTMP convolution algorithm. The HNTMP convolution algorithm achieves $14.6 \times$ speedup than the most popular \textit{im2col} convolution algorithm, and $2.30 \times$ speedup than the fastest existing convolution algorithm (direct convolution) as far as we know.
FusionAccel: A General Re-configurable Deep Learning Inference Accelerator on FPGA for Convolutional Neural Networks	The deep learning accelerator is one of the methods to accelerate deep learning network computations, which is mainly based on convolutional neural network acceleration. To address the fact that concurrent convolutional neural network accelerators are not solely open-source and the exclusiveness of platforms, FusionAccel, a scalable convolutional neural network accelerator hardware architecture with supporting software is proposed. It can adapt to different network structures and can be reconstructed before compilation and reconfigured at runtime. This paper realizes this RTL convolutional neural network accelerator design and functional verifications on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. The result is identical to that of Caffe-CPU. Since the entire project is based on RTL, it can be migrated to ASIC after replacing some FPGA-specific IPs.
Interleaved Group Convolutions for Deep Neural Networks	In this paper, we present a simple and modularized neural network architecture, named interleaved group convolutional neural networks (IGCNets). The main point lies in a novel building block, a pair of two successive interleaved group convolutions: primary group convolution and secondary group convolution. The two group convolutions are complementary: (i) the convolution on each partition in primary group convolution is a spatial convolution, while on each partition in secondary group convolution, the convolution is a point-wise convolution; (ii) the channels in the same secondary partition come from different primary partitions. We discuss one representative advantage: Wider than a regular convolution with the number of parameters and the computation complexity preserved. We also show that regular convolutions, group convolution with summation fusion, and the Xception block are special cases of interleaved group convolutions. Empirical results over standard benchmarks, CIFAR-$10$, CIFAR-$100$, SVHN and ImageNet demonstrate that our networks are more efficient in using parameters and computation complexity with similar or higher accuracy.
Support Spinor Machine	We generalize a support vector machine to a support spinor machine by using the mathematical structure of wedge product over vector machine in order to extend field from vector field to spinor field. The separated hyperplane is extended to Kolmogorov space in time series data which allow us to extend a structure of support vector machine to a support tensor machine and a support tensor machine moduli space. Our performance test on support spinor machine is done over one class classification of end point in physiology state of time series data after empirical mode analysis and compared with support vector machine test. We implement algorithm of support spinor machine by using Holo-Hilbert amplitude modulation for fully nonlinear and nonstationary time series data analysis.
Convexified Convolutional Neural Networks	We describe the class of convexified convolutional neural networks (CCNNs), which capture the parameter sharing of convolutional neural networks in a convex manner. By representing the nonlinear convolutional filters as vectors in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the CNN parameters can be represented as a low-rank matrix, which can be relaxed to obtain a convex optimization problem. For learning two-layer convolutional neural networks, we prove that the generalization error obtained by a convexified CNN converges to that of the best possible CNN. For learning deeper networks, we train CCNNs in a layer-wise manner. Empirically, CCNNs achieve performance competitive with CNNs trained by backpropagation, SVMs, fully-connected neural networks, stacked denoising auto-encoders, and other baseline methods.
Convolutional Neural Networks with Recurrent Neural Filters	We introduce a class of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as convolution filters. A convolution filter is typically implemented as a linear affine transformation followed by a non-linear function, which fails to account for language compositionality. As a result, it limits the use of high-order filters that are often warranted for natural language processing tasks. In this work, we model convolution filters with RNNs that naturally capture compositionality and long-term dependencies in language. We show that simple CNN architectures equipped with recurrent neural filters (RNFs) achieve results that are on par with the best published ones on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and two answer sentence selection datasets.
Geometrization of deep networks for the interpretability of deep learning systems	How to understand deep learning systems remains an open problem. In this paper we propose that the answer may lie in the geometrization of deep networks. Geometrization is a bridge to connect physics, geometry, deep network and quantum computation and this may result in a new scheme to reveal the rule of the physical world. By comparing the geometry of image matching and deep networks, we show that geometrization of deep networks can be used to understand existing deep learning systems and it may also help to solve the interpretability problem of deep learning systems.
Kernel-based Translations of Convolutional Networks	Convolutional Neural Networks, as most artificial neural networks, are commonly viewed as methods different in essence from kernel-based methods. We provide a systematic translation of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) into their kernel-based counterparts, Convolutional Kernel Networks (CKNs), and demonstrate that this perception is unfounded both formally and empirically. We show that, given a Convolutional Neural Network, we can design a corresponding Convolutional Kernel Network, easily trainable using a new stochastic gradient algorithm based on an accurate gradient computation, that performs on par with its Convolutional Neural Network counterpart. We present experimental results supporting our claims on landmark ConvNet architectures comparing each ConvNet to its CKN counterpart over several parameter settings.
True Asymptotic Natural Gradient Optimization	We introduce a simple algorithm, True Asymptotic Natural Gradient Optimization (TANGO), that converges to a true natural gradient descent in the limit of small learning rates, without explicit Fisher matrix estimation. For quadratic models the algorithm is also an instance of averaged stochastic gradient, where the parameter is a moving average of a "fast", constant-rate gradient descent. TANGO appears as a particular de-linearization of averaged SGD, and is sometimes quite different on non-quadratic models. This further connects averaged SGD and natural gradient, both of which are arguably optimal asymptotically. In large dimension, small learning rates will be required to approximate the natural gradient well. Still, this shows it is possible to get arbitrarily close to exact natural gradient descent with a lightweight algorithm.
Techniques for Automated Machine Learning	Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to find optimal machine learning solutions automatically given a machine learning problem. It could release the burden of data scientists from the multifarious manual tuning process and enable the access of domain experts to the off-the-shelf machine learning solutions without extensive experience. In this paper, we review the current developments of AutoML in terms of three categories, automated feature engineering (AutoFE), automated model and hyperparameter learning (AutoMHL), and automated deep learning (AutoDL). State-of-the-art techniques adopted in the three categories are presented, including Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm, and gradient-based approaches. We summarize popular AutoML frameworks and conclude with current open challenges of AutoML.
Understanding Bias in Machine Learning	Bias is known to be an impediment to fair decisions in many domains such as human resources, the public sector, health care etc. Recently, hope has been expressed that the use of machine learning methods for taking such decisions would diminish or even resolve the problem. At the same time, machine learning experts warn that machine learning models can be biased as well. In this article, our goal is to explain the issue of bias in machine learning from a technical perspective and to illustrate the impact that biased data can have on a machine learning model. To reach such a goal, we develop interactive plots to visualizing the bias learned from synthetic data.
Support vector machines/relevance vector machine for remote sensing classification: A review	Kernel-based machine learning algorithms are based on mapping data from the original input feature space to a kernel feature space of higher dimensionality to solve a linear problem in that space. Over the last decade, kernel based classification and regression approaches such as support vector machines have widely been used in remote sensing as well as in various civil engineering applications. In spite of their better performance with different datasets, support vector machines still suffer from shortcomings such as visualization/interpretation of model, choice of kernel and kernel specific parameter as well as the regularization parameter. Relevance vector machines are another kernel based approach being explored for classification and regression with in last few years. The advantages of the relevance vector machines over the support vector machines is the availability of probabilistic predictions, using arbitrary kernel functions and not requiring setting of the regularization parameter. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of SVM and RVM in remote sensing and provides some details of their use in other civil engineering application also.
Moving Deep Learning into Web Browser: How Far Can We Go?	Recently, several JavaScript-based deep learning frameworks have emerged, making it possible to perform deep learning tasks directly in browsers. However, little is known on what and how well we can do with these frameworks for deep learning in browsers. To bridge the knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of deep learning in browsers. We survey 7 most popular JavaScript-based deep learning frameworks, investigating to what extent deep learning tasks have been supported in browsers so far. Then we measure the performance of different frameworks when running different deep learning tasks. Finally, we dig out the performance gap between deep learning in browsers and on native platforms by comparing the performance of TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow in Python. Our findings could help application developers, deep-learning framework vendors and browser vendors to improve the efficiency of deep learning in browsers.
Deep Learning in Software Engineering	Recent years, deep learning is increasingly prevalent in the field of Software Engineering (SE). However, many open issues still remain to be investigated. How do researchers integrate deep learning into SE problems? Which SE phases are facilitated by deep learning? Do practitioners benefit from deep learning? The answers help practitioners and researchers develop practical deep learning models for SE tasks. To answer these questions, we conduct a bibliography analysis on 98 research papers in SE that use deep learning techniques. We find that 41 SE tasks in all SE phases have been facilitated by deep learning integrated solutions. In which, 84.7% papers only use standard deep learning models and their variants to solve SE problems. The practicability becomes a concern in utilizing deep learning techniques. How to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, understandability, and testability of deep learning based solutions may attract more SE researchers in the future.
Greedy Deep Dictionary Learning	In this work we propose a new deep learning tool called deep dictionary learning. Multi-level dictionaries are learnt in a greedy fashion, one layer at a time. This requires solving a simple (shallow) dictionary learning problem, the solution to this is well known. We apply the proposed technique on some benchmark deep learning datasets. We compare our results with other deep learning tools like stacked autoencoder and deep belief network; and state of the art supervised dictionary learning tools like discriminative KSVD and label consistent KSVD. Our method yields better results than all.
Introduction to Machine Learning: Class Notes 67577	Introduction to Machine learning covering Statistical Inference (Bayes, EM, ML/MaxEnt duality), algebraic and spectral methods (PCA, LDA, CCA, Clustering), and PAC learning (the Formal model, VC dimension, Double Sampling theorem).
Combining Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks for Relation Classification	This paper investigates two different neural architectures for the task of relation classification: convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. For both models, we demonstrate the effect of different architectural choices. We present a new context representation for convolutional neural networks for relation classification (extended middle context). Furthermore, we propose connectionist bi-directional recurrent neural networks and introduce ranking loss for their optimization. Finally, we show that combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks using a simple voting scheme is accurate enough to improve results. Our neural models achieve state-of-the-art results on the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.
Why & When Deep Learning Works: Looking Inside Deep Learnings	The Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Computational Intelligence (ICRI-CI) has been heavily supporting Machine Learning and Deep Learning research from its foundation in 2012. We have asked six leading ICRI-CI Deep Learning researchers to address the challenge of "Why & When Deep Learning works", with the goal of looking inside Deep Learning, providing insights on how deep networks function, and uncovering key observations on their expressiveness, limitations, and potential. The output of this challenge resulted in five papers that address different facets of deep learning. These different facets include a high-level understating of why and when deep networks work (and do not work), the impact of geometry on the expressiveness of deep networks, and making deep networks interpretable.
RecNets: Channel-wise Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks	In this paper, we introduce Channel-wise recurrent convolutional neural networks (RecNets), a family of novel, compact neural network architectures for computer vision tasks inspired by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RecNets build upon Channel-wise recurrent convolutional (CRC) layers, a novel type of convolutional layer that splits the input channels into disjoint segments and processes them in a recurrent fashion. In this way, we simulate wide, yet compact models, since the number of parameters is vastly reduced via the parameter sharing of the RNN formulation. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification tasks demonstrate the superior size-accuracy trade-off of RecNets compared to other compact state-of-the-art architectures.
An Introduction to Quaternion-Valued Recurrent Projection Neural Networks	Hypercomplex-valued neural networks, including quaternion-valued neural networks, can treat multi-dimensional data as a single entity. In this paper, we introduce the quaternion-valued recurrent projection neural networks (QRPNNs). Briefly, QRPNNs are obtained by combining the non-local projection learning with the quaternion-valued recurrent correlation neural network (QRCNNs). We show that QRPNNs overcome the cross-talk problem of QRCNNs. Thus, they are appropriate to implement associative memories. Furthermore, computational experiments reveal that QRPNNs exhibit greater storage capacity and noise tolerance than their corresponding QRCNNs.
Feedforward Sequential Memory Neural Networks without Recurrent Feedback	We introduce a new structure for memory neural networks, called feedforward sequential memory networks (FSMN), which can learn long-term dependency without using recurrent feedback. The proposed FSMN is a standard feedforward neural networks equipped with learnable sequential memory blocks in the hidden layers. In this work, we have applied FSMN to several language modeling (LM) tasks. Experimental results have shown that the memory blocks in FSMN can learn effective representations of long history. Experiments have shown that FSMN based language models can significantly outperform not only feedforward neural network (FNN) based LMs but also the popular recurrent neural network (RNN) LMs.
On the Dynamics of a Recurrent Hopfield Network	In this research paper novel real/complex valued recurrent Hopfield Neural Network (RHNN) is proposed. The method of synthesizing the energy landscape of such a network and the experimental investigation of dynamics of Recurrent Hopfield Network is discussed. Parallel modes of operation (other than fully parallel mode) in layered RHNN is proposed. Also, certain potential applications are proposed.
DizzyRNN: Reparameterizing Recurrent Neural Networks for Norm-Preserving Backpropagation	The vanishing and exploding gradient problems are well-studied obstacles that make it difficult for recurrent neural networks to learn long-term time dependencies. We propose a reparameterization of standard recurrent neural networks to update linear transformations in a provably norm-preserving way through Givens rotations. Additionally, we use the absolute value function as an element-wise non-linearity to preserve the norm of backpropagated signals over the entire network. We show that this reparameterization reduces the number of parameters and maintains the same algorithmic complexity as a standard recurrent neural network, while outperforming standard recurrent neural networks with orthogonal initializations and Long Short-Term Memory networks on the copy problem.
Gradient descent in some simple settings	In this note, we observe the behavior of gradient flow and discrete and noisy gradient descent in some simple settings. It is commonly noted that addition of noise to gradient descent can affect the trajectory of gradient descent. Here, we run some computer experiments for gradient descent on some simple functions, and observe this principle in some concrete examples.
Big Data Quantum Support Vector Clustering	Clustering is a complex process in finding the relevant hidden patterns in unlabeled datasets, broadly known as unsupervised learning. Support vector clustering algorithm is a well-known clustering algorithm based on support vector machines and Gaussian kernels. In this paper, we have investigated the support vector clustering algorithm in quantum paradigm. We have developed a quantum algorithm which is based on quantum support vector machine and the quantum kernel (Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel) formulation. The investigation exhibits approximately exponential speed up in the quantum version with respect to the classical counterpart.
Qualitative Robustness of Support Vector Machines	Support vector machines have attracted much attention in theoretical and in applied statistics. Main topics of recent interest are consistency, learning rates and robustness. In this article, it is shown that support vector machines are qualitatively robust. Since support vector machines can be represented by a functional on the set of all probability measures, qualitative robustness is proven by showing that this functional is continuous with respect to the topology generated by weak convergence of probability measures. Combined with the existence and uniqueness of support vector machines, our results show that support vector machines are the solutions of a well-posed mathematical problem in Hadamard's sense.
Survey on Automated Machine Learning	Machine learning has become a vital part in many aspects of our daily life. However, building well performing machine learning applications requires highly specialized data scientists and domain experts. Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to reduce the demand for data scientists by enabling domain experts to automatically build machine learning applications without extensive knowledge of statistics and machine learning. In this survey, we summarize the recent developments in academy and industry regarding AutoML. First, we introduce a holistic problem formulation. Next, approaches for solving various subproblems of AutoML are presented. Finally, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of the presented approaches on synthetic and real data.
Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling	In this paper we compare different types of recurrent units in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Especially, we focus on more sophisticated units that implement a gating mechanism, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a recently proposed gated recurrent unit (GRU). We evaluate these recurrent units on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. Our experiments revealed that these advanced recurrent units are indeed better than more traditional recurrent units such as tanh units. Also, we found GRU to be comparable to LSTM.
Opening the black box of deep learning	The great success of deep learning shows that its technology contains profound truth, and understanding its internal mechanism not only has important implications for the development of its technology and effective application in various fields, but also provides meaningful insights into the understanding of human brain mechanism. At present, most of the theoretical research on deep learning is based on mathematics. This dissertation proposes that the neural network of deep learning is a physical system, examines deep learning from three different perspectives: microscopic, macroscopic, and physical world views, answers multiple theoretical puzzles in deep learning by using physics principles. For example, from the perspective of quantum mechanics and statistical physics, this dissertation presents the calculation methods for convolution calculation, pooling, normalization, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine, as well as the selection of cost functions, explains why deep learning must be deep, what characteristics are learned in deep learning, why Convolutional Neural Networks do not have to be trained layer by layer, and the limitations of deep learning, etc., and proposes the theoretical direction and basis for the further development of deep learning now and in the future. The brilliance of physics flashes in deep learning, we try to establish the deep learning technology based on the scientific theory of physics.
Minimal Support Vector Machine	Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an efficient classification approach, which finds a hyperplane to separate data from different classes. This hyperplane is determined by support vectors. In existing SVM formulations, the objective function uses L2 norm or L1 norm on slack variables. The number of support vectors is a measure of generalization errors. In this work, we propose a Minimal SVM, which uses L0.5 norm on slack variables. The result model further reduces the number of support vectors and increases the classification performance.
A Unified Analytical Framework for Trustable Machine Learning and Automation Running with Blockchain	Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.
What Really is Deep Learning Doing?	Deep learning has achieved a great success in many areas, from computer vision to natural language processing, to game playing, and much more. Yet, what deep learning is really doing is still an open question. There are a lot of works in this direction. For example, [5] tried to explain deep learning by group renormalization, and [6] tried to explain deep learning from the view of functional approximation. In order to address this very crucial question, here we see deep learning from perspective of mechanical learning and learning machine (see [1], [2]). From this particular angle, we can see deep learning much better and answer with confidence: What deep learning is really doing? why it works well, how it works, and how much data is necessary for learning. We also will discuss advantages and disadvantages of deep learning at the end of this work.
Block Coordinate Descent Only Converge to Minimizers	Given a non-convex twice continuously differentiable cost function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, we prove that all of block coordinate gradient descent, block mirror descent and proximal block coordinate descent converge to a local minimizer, almost surely with random initialization. Furthermore, we show that these results also hold true even for the cost functions with non-isolated critical points.
Analysis of Natural Gradient Descent for Multilayer Neural Networks	Natural gradient descent is a principled method for adapting the parameters of a statistical model on-line using an underlying Riemannian parameter space to redefine the direction of steepest descent. The algorithm is examined via methods of statistical physics which accurately characterize both transient and asymptotic behavior. A solution of the learning dynamics is obtained for the case of multilayer neural network training in the limit of large input dimension. We find that natural gradient learning leads to optimal asymptotic performance and outperforms gradient descent in the transient, significantly shortening or even removing plateaus in the transient generalization performance which typically hamper gradient descent training.
Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with dynamic sample sizes	We focus on solving constrained convex optimization problems using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. Dynamic sample size rules are presented which ensure a descent direction with high probability. Empirical results from two applications show superior convergence compared to fixed sample implementations.
An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning	I describe an optimal control view of adversarial machine learning, where the dynamical system is the machine learner, the input are adversarial actions, and the control costs are defined by the adversary's goals to do harm and be hard to detect. This view encompasses many types of adversarial machine learning, including test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward shaping. The view encourages adversarial machine learning researcher to utilize advances in control theory and reinforcement learning.
Faster gradient descent and the efficient recovery of images	Much recent attention has been devoted to gradient descent algorithms where the steepest descent step size is replaced by a similar one from a previous iteration or gets updated only once every second step, thus forming a {\em faster gradient descent method}. For unconstrained convex quadratic optimization these methods can converge much faster than steepest descent. But the context of interest here is application to certain ill-posed inverse problems, where the steepest descent method is known to have a smoothing, regularizing effect, and where a strict optimization solution is not necessary. Specifically, in this paper we examine the effect of replacing steepest descent by a faster gradient descent algorithm in the practical context of image deblurring and denoising tasks. We also propose several highly efficient schemes for carrying out these tasks independently of the step size selection, as well as a scheme for the case where both blur and significant noise are present. In the above context there are situations where many steepest descent steps are required, thus building slowness into the solution procedure. Our general conclusion regarding gradient descent methods is that in such cases the faster gradient descent methods offer substantial advantages. In other situations where no such slowness buildup arises the steepest descent method can still be very effective.
A First Look at Deep Learning Apps on Smartphones	We are in the dawn of deep learning explosion for smartphones. To bridge the gap between research and practice, we present the first empirical study on 16,500 the most popular Android apps, demystifying how smartphone apps exploit deep learning in the wild. To this end, we build a new static tool that dissects apps and analyzes their deep learning functions. Our study answers threefold questions: what are the early adopter apps of deep learning, what do they use deep learning for, and how do their deep learning models look like. Our study has strong implications for app developers, smartphone vendors, and deep learning R\&D. On one hand, our findings paint a promising picture of deep learning for smartphones, showing the prosperity of mobile deep learning frameworks as well as the prosperity of apps building their cores atop deep learning. On the other hand, our findings urge optimizations on deep learning models deployed on smartphones, the protection of these models, and validation of research ideas on these models.

A novel improved fuzzy support vector machine based stock price trend forecast model	Application of fuzzy support vector machine in stock price forecast. Support vector machine is a new type of machine learning method proposed in 1990s. It can deal with classification and regression problems very successfully. Due to the excellent learning performance of support vector machine, the technology has become a hot research topic in the field of machine learning, and it has been successfully applied in many fields. However, as a new technology, there are many limitations to support vector machines. There is a large amount of fuzzy information in the objective world. If the training of support vector machine contains noise and fuzzy information, the performance of the support vector machine will become very weak and powerless. As the complexity of many factors influence the stock price prediction, the prediction results of traditional support vector machine cannot meet people with precision, this study improved the traditional support vector machine fuzzy prediction algorithm is proposed to improve the new model precision. NASDAQ Stock Market, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Stock market are considered. Novel advanced- fuzzy support vector machine (NA-FSVM) is the proposed methodology.
Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with short learning samples	The article is devoted to the problem of small learning samples in machine learning. The flaws of maximum likelihood learning and minimax learning are looked into and the concept of minimax deviation learning is introduced that is free of those flaws.
General Vector Machine	The support vector machine (SVM) is an important class of learning machines for function approach, pattern recognition, and time-serious prediction, etc. It maps samples into the feature space by so-called support vectors of selected samples, and then feature vectors are separated by maximum margin hyperplane. The present paper presents the general vector machine (GVM) to replace the SVM. The support vectors are replaced by general project vectors selected from the usual vector space, and a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is developed to find the general vectors. The general project vectors improves the feature-extraction ability, and the MC algorithm can control the width of the separation margin of the hyperplane. By controlling the separation margin, we show that the maximum margin hyperplane can usually induce the overlearning, and the best learning machine is achieved with a proper separation margin. Applications in function approach, pattern recognition, and classification indicate that the developed method is very successful, particularly for small-set training problems. Additionally, our algorithm may induce some particular applications, such as for the transductive inference.
Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting	Time series forecasting is difficult. It is difficult even for recurrent neural networks with their inherent ability to learn sequentiality. This article presents a recurrent neural network based time series forecasting framework covering feature engineering, feature importances, point and interval predictions, and forecast evaluation. The description of the method is followed by an empirical study using both LSTM and GRU networks.
Gradient descent revisited via an adaptive online learning rate	Any gradient descent optimization requires to choose a learning rate. With deeper and deeper models, tuning that learning rate can easily become tedious and does not necessarily lead to an ideal convergence. We propose a variation of the gradient descent algorithm in the which the learning rate is not fixed. Instead, we learn the learning rate itself, either by another gradient descent (first-order method), or by Newton's method (second-order). This way, gradient descent for any machine learning algorithm can be optimized.
Concept-Oriented Deep Learning	Concepts are the foundation of human deep learning, understanding, and knowledge integration and transfer. We propose concept-oriented deep learning (CODL) which extends (machine) deep learning with concept representations and conceptual understanding capability. CODL addresses some of the major limitations of deep learning: interpretability, transferability, contextual adaptation, and requirement for lots of labeled training data. We discuss the major aspects of CODL including concept graph, concept representations, concept exemplars, and concept representation learning systems supporting incremental and continual learning.
